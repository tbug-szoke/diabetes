## Presentation 

### Selected topic:

For our CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp Project our group has choosen to analyze diabetes health indicators to help predict a patients risk level for diabetes

### Reason for the selected topic:

We choose this topic because it is interesting and relevant. Diabetes is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. Most people today, either personally sturggle with Diabetes or know someone who does. Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate levels of glucose in the blood, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models for diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials.

### Description data source:

This original dataset contains responses from 441,455 individuals and has 330 features. These features are either questions directly asked of participants, or calculated variables based on individual participant responses.

This dataset contains 3 files:

- diabetes _ 012 _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables
- diabetes _ binary _ 5050split _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 70,692 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. It has an equal 50-50 split of respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is balanced.
- diabetes _ binary _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.


### Questions they hope to answer with the data

- Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?
- What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?
- Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?
- Can we create a short form of questions using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?
